# Story 1.2: Dataset Loading and Management

## Status

Ready for Done

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to implement dataset loading from CSV files and create a data management system,
**so that** the application can load and process UCI Wine Quality datasets for visualization.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Application can load red and white wine CSV datasets from the public directory within 2 seconds
2. CSV data is parsed into structured JavaScript objects with proper type validation
3. Data management system can handle both datasets and switch between them in less than 100ms
4. Dataset metadata is extracted and made available to the UI through dedicated getter methods
5. Error handling is implemented for file loading failures with user-friendly error messages displayed in the UI
6. All errors are logged to the console with appropriate error levels (error, warn, info)
7. Memory usage does not exceed 50MB per dataset during loading and parsing

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Data Models

Based on the architecture document, the data models are:

**WineDataPoint:**

```typescript
interface WineDataPoint {
  fixedAcidity: number;
  volatileAcidity: number;
  citricAcid: number;
  residualSugar: number;
  chlorides: number;
  freeSulfurDioxide: number;
  totalSulfurDioxide: number;
  density: number;
  pH: number;
  sulphates: number;
  alcohol: number;
  quality: number;
}
```

**DatasetInfo:**

```typescript
interface DatasetInfo {
  type: 'red' | 'white';
  source: string;
  doi: string;
  totalInstances: number;
  features: string[];
}
```

### File Locations

- Red wine dataset: `/public/data/winequality-red.csv`
- White wine dataset: `/public/data/winequality-white.csv`

### Expected CSV Format

Example of the expected CSV format (first few columns of red wine dataset):

```
"fixed acidity","volatile acidity","citric acid","residual sugar","chlorides","free sulfur dioxide","total sulfur dioxide","density","pH","sulphates","alcohol","quality"
7.4,0.7,0,1.9,0.076,11,34,0.9978,3.51,0.56,9.4,5
7.8,0.88,0,2.6,0.098,25,67,0.9968,3.2,0.68,9.8,5
```

### Implementation Approach

- Use Papa Parse as the CSV parsing library (already included in Strudel Kit dependencies)
- Load both datasets on application initialization
- Store datasets in memory for fast access
- Implement lazy loading if datasets are too large (>10MB)
- Optimize parsing for performance with streaming if needed

### Performance Targets

- Dataset loading and parsing should complete within 2 seconds on modern browsers
- Memory usage should not exceed 50MB for each dataset
- Dataset switching should be instantaneous (<100ms)

### Testing Standards

- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit/data/` directory
- Test data parsing with various CSV formats (valid, malformed, empty files)
- Test error scenarios with invalid CSV files and network errors
- Mock file loading for unit tests
- Test dataset switching functionality
- Performance tests to verify loading times meet targets

### Review Date: 2025-09-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Summary**

- Loader/parsing stack now centralises CSV ingestion with retries, metrics, and anomaly tracking; UI surfaces dataset metadata and load telemetry.
- All new logic is exercised by focused unit suites; vitest run passes (59 tests) without regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria & Coverage**

- AC1 (≤2s load for both datasets): `loadDatasetCsv` measures duration and warns when thresholds breached; covered by `tests/unit/data/csvLoader.test.ts`.
- AC2 (structured parsing with validation): `parseWineDataset` enforces numeric conversion and defaulting; verified by `tests/unit/data/parseWineDataset.test.ts`.
- AC3 (dataset switching <100 ms): Cache-first retrieval ensures instant toggles with instrumentation via `WineDataManager`; validated through caching and event tests in `tests/unit/data/WineDataManager.test.ts`.
- AC4 (metadata surfaced): Metadata cache plumbed into context and InfoPanel, confirmed in `tests/unit/components/InfoPanel.test.tsx`.
- AC5 (user-friendly error handling): Normalised errors log via `errorLogger` and render in InfoPanel; covered in InfoPanel/context tests.
- AC6 (structured logging): `errorLogger` integration exercised in context retry flow (`tests/unit/context/WineDataContext.test.tsx`).
- AC7 (≤50 MB memory usage): Loader enforces size ceiling with dedicated unit coverage in `tests/unit/data/csvLoader.test.ts`.

**Tests Executed**

- `npm test`
- `npm test -- tests/unit/components/DatasetSelector.test.tsx`

**Risks & Observations**

- Loader currently emits console warnings when latency thresholds exceed targets; consider wiring this into telemetry to spot real-world regressions.
- Stored anomaly metadata is not yet surfaced to the UI—future analytics could leverage it for data quality insight.

**Gate Decision**

- PASS – see `docs/qa/gates/1.2.dataset-loading-and-management.yml`.
- Recommended Status: Ready for Done.
