## Story

**As a** academic facilitator referencing the Wine Quality research,  
**I want** the landing page copy and references to align with the original UCI study,  
**so that** students immediately understand the provenance, methodology, and learning objectives sourced from Cortez et al. (2009).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Hero and descriptive copy explicitly reference the Portuguese Vinho Verde datasets and the “Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties” research by Cortez et al. (2009).
2. Landing page includes direct links to the original paper (PDF), the UCI Machine Learning Repository entry, and the ucimlrepo GitHub resource cited by the PRD.
3. Reference dossier (or equivalent supporting section) enumerates sample sizes, key physicochemical variables, and the modeling focus (regression-based quality prediction) highlighted in the paper.
4. Existing navigation and routing (CTA to `/wine-explorer`) continue to function unchanged.
5. Updated copy preserves the existing typographic/density pattern established in the Are.na-inspired redesign.
6. Visualization accessibility controls (“Help” and “High contrast”) remain within the visualization header and unchanged in behavior.
7. Unit/storybook or snapshot coverage updated if copy blocks are snapshot-tested; otherwise manual verification logged.
8. Copy is reviewed for factual accuracy against the original paper and dataset sources.
9. No regressions in layout spacing or typography (per design tokens) verified in local build.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Audit current landing content in `src/pages/index.tsx` (AC: 1,2,3)
- [ ] Update hero, descriptive sections, and reference dossier copy to cite Cortez et al. (2009) and UCI sources (AC: 1,2,3,5)
- [ ] Add or update external links (paper PDF, UCI dataset, ucimlrepo GitHub) with `target="_blank"` + `rel="noreferrer"` via `AppLink` or `<a>` as appropriate (AC: 2,5)
- [ ] Validate CTA behavior and navigation, ensuring `/wine-explorer` route remains functional (AC: 4)
- [ ] Run responsive/manual regression to confirm typography, spacing, and accessibility controls remain intact (AC: 5,6,9)
- [ ] Execute unit/snapshot tests or document manual verification, recording factual accuracy review against sources (AC: 7,8)
- [ ] Capture results in story Testing section and update change log (AC: 7,8,9)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture & Source References

- Landing page content lives in `src/pages/index.tsx` (React + MUI layout); referenced by Epic 4 scope (.agents/prd/epic-4-research-aligned-single-page.md).
- Existing academic tone and layout were established during the Are.na refresh; maintain spacing tokens and typography variants already used in the `featureSections` and `workflowSteps` arrays.
- Use `AppLink` (in `src/components/AppLink.tsx`) for internal navigation consistency, and Material UI `Typography`, `Stack`, `Box` primitives per current design system.
- External citations must reference:
  - UCI dataset overview: `https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality`
  - Data citation repository: `https://github.com/uci-ml-repo/ucimlrepo`
  - Cortez et al. paper PDF: `https://repositorium.uminho.pt/server/api/core/bitstreams/f3dd2aa2-9eda-4eba-b50e-6306a0bd0c66/content`

### Testing

- Snapshot/unit coverage: rerun `npm test` if any snapshot or Jest assertions cover landing copy. Update snapshots when wording changes are intentional.
- Manual checks:
  - Validate CTA still routes to `/wine-explorer` and preserves keyboard focus.
  - Confirm external links open in new tabs with `rel="noreferrer"`.
  - Verify references render without overflow at 320 px, 768 px, and 1280 px widths.
  - Screen reader sanity pass for updated copy blocks (hero, reference dossier).
- Record factual review by cross-checking text against Cortez et al. (2009) and UCI dataset page (AC 8).
