# Align Landing Page Content with UCI Research - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As an academic facilitator referencing the Wine Quality research,
I want the landing page copy and references to align with the original UCI study,
So that students immediately understand the provenance, methodology, and learning objectives sourced from Cortez et al. (2009).

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: `src/pages/index.tsx`
- Technology: React + MUI (Vite SPA)
- Follows pattern: Current landing page typographic layout introduced in the Are.na-inspired refresh
- Touch points: Landing page hero narrative, "Reference dossier" section, research links

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Hero and descriptive copy explicitly reference the Portuguese Vinho Verde datasets and the “Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties” research by Cortez et al. (2009).
2. Landing page includes direct links to the original paper (PDF), the UCI Machine Learning Repository entry, and the ucimlrepo GitHub resource cited by the PRD.
3. Reference dossier (or equivalent supporting section) enumerates sample sizes, key physicochemical variables, and the modeling focus (classification/regression quality prediction) highlighted in the paper.

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing navigation and routing (CTA to `/wine-explorer`) continue to function unchanged.
5. Updated copy preserves the existing typographic/density pattern established in the recent Are.na-inspired redesign.
6. Visualization accessibility controls (“Help” and “High contrast”) remain within the visualization header and unchanged in behavior.

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Unit/storybook or snapshot coverage updated if copy blocks are snapshot-tested; otherwise manual verification logged.
8. Copy is reviewed for factual accuracy against the original paper and dataset sources.
9. No regressions in layout spacing or typography (per design tokens) verified in local build.

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update static JSX content and link targets within `src/pages/index.tsx`; no new components required.
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow the current sectioned layout with typographic hierarchy introduced in the recent landing page refresh.
- **Key Constraints:** Maintain academic tone and avoid marketing language; keep copy concise enough to preserve existing layout without overflow.
- **Source Material:**
  - Original dataset overview – UCI Machine Learning Repository (`https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality`)
  - Data citation GitHub reference – `https://github.com/uci-ml-repo/ucimlrepo`
  - Cortez et al. paper PDF – `https://repositorium.uminho.pt/server/api/core/bitstreams/f3dd2aa2-9eda-4eba-b50e-6306a0bd0c66/content`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

- **Primary Risk:** Misrepresenting the original research or overcrowding the layout with dense academic copy.
- **Mitigation:** Validate copy against the Cortez et al. (2009) paper and preview layout locally with responsive QA.
- **Rollback:** Revert `src/pages/index.tsx` to pre-story revision commit.

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward
- [ ] Follows existing patterns exactly
- [ ] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified
- [ ] Success criteria are testable
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple
