# Story 3.4: Final Testing and Deployment

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to perform final testing and prepare the application for deployment,
**so that** the prototype is ready for demonstration and meets all requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) pass locally.
2. Regression testing confirms PRD functional requirements are satisfied.
3. Updated documentation (README or repo docs) explains how to run the demo for presentations.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Finalize automated testing suite
  - [x] Run all unit and integration tests
  - [x] Run E2E smoke suite (core user journeys)
  - [x] Fix any failing tests
  - [x] Add missing tests for critical functionality uncovered during regression
- [x] Validate requirements
  - [x] Review PRD functional requirements
  - [x] Verify all requirements are implemented
  - [x] Test key user flows
  - [x] Document any missing functionality
- [x] Repository demo readiness
  - [x] Ensure `npm install && npm start` instructions are accurate
  - [x] Capture screenshots or short clip for demo reference (optional)
  - [x] Document key features and walkthrough steps in README or docs/demo.md
  - [x] Outline anticipated Q&A topics with supporting answers

## Dev Notes

### Testing Requirements

Based on the PRD and architecture document:

**Functional Requirements to Validate:**

1. FR1: Users can switch between red and white wine datasets with clear indication of currently selected dataset
2. FR2: Users can filter 2-3 key physicochemical features using range sliders
3. FR3: Users can view histograms and scatterplots for selected features
4. FR4: Users can see dataset metadata including source, citation, and number of instances
5. FR5: Interface is responsive and works on common device sizes

**Non-Functional Requirements to Validate:**

1. NFR1: All interactions must be client-side with no external dependencies beyond UCI dataset CSVs
2. NFR2: Code must follow Strudel kit component patterns and conventions
3. NFR3: Prototype must be completed and demonstrable within one-month timeframe

> Note: Performance metrics remain informative but are not gating for the demo deliverable. Capture observations if major regressions surface.

### Testing Strategy

Follow the testing strategy from the architecture document:

**Testing Pyramid:**

```
E2E Tests (Cypress)
/
Integration Tests (Jest)
/
Frontend Unit Tests (Jest)
```

**Test Organization:**

```
/tests
├── unit/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── data/
│   └── utils/
├── integration/
│   ├── app-flow.test.js
│   └── data-processing.test.js
└── e2e/
    ├── dataset-switching.cy.js
    ├── filtering.cy.js
    └── visualization.cy.js
```

### Demo Preparation Guidance

- Highlight the following flows during the demo:
  1. Dataset switching between red and white wines
  2. Filtering capabilities with range sliders
  3. Histogram and scatterplot visualizations
  4. Responsive behavior and accessibility affordances
- Capture quick bullet points for talking through architecture decisions, testing summary, and known limitations.
- Provide the commands for running the app locally and the location of sample data (public/data CSVs).

### Validation Checklist

Create a final validation checklist to ensure all requirements are met:

**Functional Validation:**

- [x] Dataset switching works correctly
- [x] Filtering updates visualizations in real-time
- [x] Histogram visualization displays correctly
- [x] Scatterplot visualization displays correctly
- [x] Dataset metadata is displayed
- [x] Application is responsive on all device sizes

**Quality Validation:**

- [x] All automated tests (unit/integration/E2E) pass locally
- [x] Smoke walkthrough completed using README/demo guide
- [x] Outstanding bugs triaged with workaround or follow-up story

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Gate Decision: FAIL

### Summary

- Automated vitest suite currently fails (4 failing specs) due to mismatched expectations around the new camelCase `WineDataPoint` shape; story does not meet “all automated tests pass” acceptance criterion.
- Build health risk: `FilterPanel` imports `debounce` from `@mui/material`, which is not exported; TypeScript build will fail once `tsc` runs.

### Issues

- tests/unit/data/parseWineDataset.test.ts:19 – Assertions still reference kebab-case keys (`'fixed acidity'`, `'citric acid'`); actual parser now returns camelCase properties, so tests fail.
- tests/unit/data/WineDataManager.test.ts:37 & :128 – SAMPLE_DATA uses kebab-case property names, so filter/range logic sees `NaN`/`undefined` and tests fail; update fixtures to camelCase.
- src/components/FilterPanel.tsx:16 – `debounce` must be imported from `@mui/material/utils`; current import causes compile-time failure.

### Recommendations

- Update unit tests (and any remaining code) to use camelCase property names that match the new parser output, then rerun `npm test`.
- Fix the `debounce` import (`import { debounce } from '@mui/material/utils'`) and re-run `npm run build`.
- After fixes, rerun full regression (`npm test`, `npm run build`, targeted smoke of dataset switching + filtering + viz) and capture results in story File List if any files change.

### Test Evidence

- `npm test` → FAIL (4 failing specs; see issues above)

### Review Date: 2025-10-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Gate Decision: PASS

- Restored vitest suite to green after camelCase fixture updates; verified with `npm test`.
- Confirmed Vite production build succeeds post `FilterPanel` debounce import fix.
- Manually validated dataset switching, filtering, and visualization flows using fresh build.
- Recommendation: Promote to Ready for Done once PM confirms documentation updates.

### Review Date: 2025-10-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Gate Decision: PASS

- Regression: `npm test -- --run` (59 specs) passes after logging enhancement ensuring slow CSV loads emit warnings for observability.
- Spot-check: Verified console warning triggers when mocked load exceeds 2 s threshold.
- Documentation: No new user-facing docs required; existing `docs/demo.md` still current.
- Observation: Story checklists remain unchecked despite work completion—request Dev/SM update checkboxes before final sign-off.
- Recommendation: Ready for Done once checklists reflect completion; no code changes required beyond merged warning logic.
- Link to QA Gate Record: docs/qa/gates/3.4-final-testing-and-deployment.yml

### Summary

- Updated all wine data fixtures to camelCase, restoring deterministic vitest coverage across data loaders, context, and visualization components.
- Corrected `FilterPanel` debounce import and adjusted test mocks; TypeScript build now completes successfully and Vite production bundle builds without errors.
- Regression scripts (`npm test`, `npm run build`) both succeed, satisfying Acceptance Criteria 1–2; docs already cover AC3 demo instructions.

### Issues

- None observed.

### Recommendations

- Monitor initial manual demo run to confirm smoke walkthrough matches docs/demo.md; no corrective actions required.

### Test Evidence

- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
