## Dev Notes

### Testing Requirements

Based on the PRD and architecture document:

**Functional Requirements to Validate:**

1. FR1: Users can switch between red and white wine datasets with clear indication of currently selected dataset
2. FR2: Users can filter 2-3 key physicochemical features using range sliders
3. FR3: Users can view histograms and scatterplots for selected features
4. FR4: Users can see dataset metadata including source, citation, and number of instances
5. FR5: Interface is responsive and works on common device sizes

**Non-Functional Requirements to Validate:**

1. NFR1: All interactions must be client-side with no external dependencies beyond UCI dataset CSVs
2. NFR2: Application must load and render visualizations within 2 seconds on modern browsers
3. NFR3: Code must follow Strudel kit component patterns and conventions
4. NFR4: Prototype must be completed and demonstrable within one-month timeframe

### Performance Benchmarks

Based on the architecture document:

- Initial load time: < 2 seconds
- Bundle size: < 500KB
- First meaningful paint: < 1 second
- Filtering performance: < 2 seconds
- Visualization rendering: < 2 seconds

### Testing Strategy

Follow the testing strategy from the architecture document:

**Testing Pyramid:**

```
E2E Tests (Cypress)
/
Integration Tests (Jest)
/
Frontend Unit Tests (Jest)
```

**Test Organization:**

```
/tests
├── unit/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── data/
│   └── utils/
├── integration/
│   ├── app-flow.test.js
│   └── data-processing.test.js
└── e2e/
    ├── dataset-switching.cy.js
    ├── filtering.cy.js
    └── visualization.cy.js
```

### Deployment Process

Based on the architecture document:

**Deployment Strategy:**

- Platform: GitHub Pages
- Build Command: npm run build
- Output Directory: dist
- CDN/Edge: GitHub Pages CDN

**CI/CD Pipeline:**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

### Demo Script Preparation

Prepare a comprehensive demo script that showcases:

1. Dataset switching between red and white wines
2. Filtering capabilities with range sliders
3. Histogram visualization
4. Scatterplot visualization
5. Responsive design on different devices
6. Error handling and loading states
7. Accessibility features

### Validation Checklist

Create a final validation checklist to ensure all requirements are met:

**Functional Validation:**

- [ ] Dataset switching works correctly
- [ ] Filtering updates visualizations in real-time
- [ ] Histogram visualization displays correctly
- [ ] Scatterplot visualization displays correctly
- [ ] Dataset metadata is displayed
- [ ] Application is responsive on all device sizes

**Non-Functional Validation:**

- [ ] All interactions are client-side
- [ ] Load time is under 2 seconds
- [ ] Code follows Strudel kit patterns
- [ ] Application meets accessibility standards

**Quality Validation:**

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All E2E tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage is 95%+
- [ ] No critical bugs or issues
