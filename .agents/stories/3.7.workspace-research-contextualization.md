# Workspace Research Contextualization - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a data science instructor,
I want the embedded workspace to surface key facts from the original wine quality research,
So that learners connect each control and visualization to the underlying study design.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Components under `src/components/` used in the workspace (`DatasetSelector`, `FilterPanel`, `InfoPanel`, `visualizations/VisualizationArea`)
- Technology: React, Material UI, Plotly, existing accessibility utilities
- Follows pattern: Typographic tone and layout conventions from the updated landing page and workspace
- Touch points: Copy blocks within workspace panels, helper text, possibly tooltip/context additions

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Dataset selector or adjacent copy states the sample sizes (4,898 white wines, 1,599 red wines) and links to the UCI repository entry.
2. Filter panel or info panel includes succinct explanation of the 11 physicochemical attributes measured in the study.
3. Visualization area provides a contextual note reminding users that quality scores range from 0-10 and were derived from sensory tests, with a link or reference to Cortez et al. (2009).

**Integration Requirements:**

4. New text and links respect existing accessibility patterns (semantic tags, aria attributes, focus order).
5. External links open in new tabs with `rel="noreferrer"` to match existing conventions.
6. Added contextual text does not break layout responsiveness (verified at >=320px width).

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Manual QA confirms screen readers announce the new context without redundancy.
8. Local build/test succeeds with no new warnings.
9. Content reviewed against the original paper and UCI dataset entries for accuracy.

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing components with additional typography elements or helper components; avoid hard-coding lengthy paragraphs—keep concise, research-grounded messaging.
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Use `Typography` variants and stack spacing consistent with landing page; reuse `AppLink` component for internal linking where applicable.
- **Key Constraints:** Maintain subdued academic tone; ensure added text is scannable and does not overwhelm interactive controls.
- **Source Material:**
  - Dataset documentation – UCI Machine Learning Repository (`https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality`)
  - Data citation repository – `https://github.com/uci-ml-repo/ucimlrepo`
  - Cortez et al. (2009) paper – `https://repositorium.uminho.pt/server/api/core/bitstreams/f3dd2aa2-9eda-4eba-b50e-6306a0bd0c66/content`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed (e.g., README references to research context)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

- **Primary Risk:** Overloading the UI with text could hinder usability or obscure controls.
- **Mitigation:** Use concise annotations, progressive disclosure (e.g., tooltips) if necessary, and validate with target users.
- **Rollback:** Remove or revert contextual text additions while keeping layout intact.

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward
- [ ] Follows existing patterns exactly
- [ ] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified
- [ ] Success criteria are testable
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple
