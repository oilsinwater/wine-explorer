# Personas and Use Cases for Wine Dataset Exploration Tool

A practical set of user **personas** and **use cases** for a wine dataset exploration tool can be defined around the UCI Wine Quality context: physicochemical inputs, sensory quality output, and small, tidy CSV files for red and white wines.
These profiles assume a tool that supports both exploratory analysis and lightweight modeling aligned with classification/regression tasks and class imbalance considerations described for the datasets.

## Personas

These personas reflect common stakeholders who explore physicochemical measurements, relate them to sensory quality, and make decisions or learn from patterns in small, structured datasets.
They vary by goals—from building models to teaching statistics—and by needs such as feature inspection, class-aware evaluation, and clear comparisons between red and white variants.

- Data Scientist (Analytics): Seeks feature relationships and fast baselines for classification or regression on ordered quality scores, emphasizing reproducible EDA and model comparison.
- ML Engineer: Wants quick pipelines for training, validation, and export of models that map 11 numeric features to predicted quality with attention to imbalance and ordinal structure.
- Oenologist/Winemaker: Explores how acidity, sulphates, alcohol, and pH relate to sensory quality to guide experiments or process tuning.
- Quality Assurance Manager: Monitors distributions and control-like charts to detect shifts or outliers that may affect batch quality.
- Educator/Student: Uses the datasets for hands-on instruction in EDA, supervised learning, and evaluation on well-known, clean tabular data.
- Business/Marketing Analyst: Seeks interpretable summaries that translate technical variables into simple narratives for quality segmentation and positioning.
- Researcher (Food/Ag): Probes hypotheses (e.g., role of alcohol and volatile acidity) and exports subsets for external modeling or publication.
- Curious Hobbyist: Tries “what‑if” scenarios adjusting inputs to see how predicted quality might change across red vs. white wines.

## Use cases

These use cases focus on interactive exploration, interpretable modeling, and side‑by‑side comparisons across the two related datasets.
They assume clean inputs, no missing values, and small sample sizes that enable near-instant filtering and visualization.

- Explore distributions: Inspect histograms and box plots for each physicochemical feature, split by red/white and by quality bins.
- Correlation and relationships: View correlation matrices and scatterplots to assess linear and non-linear associations with quality.
- Class imbalance review: Check class counts and ordered quality levels to plan resampling or ordinal-aware modeling.
- Model quick-start: Fit baseline models (linear/regularized regression, tree/gradient boosting) and compare metrics suited to ordered targets.
- “What‑if” prediction: Input hypothetical feature values to see predicted quality and sensitivity to small changes in key variables.
- Red vs. white comparison: Toggle datasets and align plots to contrast distributions, correlations, and model feature importances.
- Outlier detection: Surface rare high or low quality cases for inspection and potential process insights.
- Teaching module: Stepwise EDA-to-model workflow with annotated visuals and downloadable notebooks or CSV subsets.
- Reporting: Generate an exportable summary with charts and narrative interpreting the most influential variables for a chosen model.

## Feature implications

Because the datasets are compact, interactivity can emphasize immediate feedback, linked filtering, and simple “edit-and-see” prediction panels.
Clear labeling and descriptions of each variable help non-technical users connect physicochemical terms to practical meaning during exploration.

- Controls: Dataset switch (red/white), quality range filter, and feature sliders for “what‑if” prediction.
- Visuals: Histograms/box plots per feature, scatterplots with optional trend lines, correlation heatmaps, and class count bars.
- Modeling: One-click baselines, cross-validation summaries, ordered-metric options, and interpretable outputs (permutation SHAP-style summaries).
- Exports: CSV of filtered subsets, model metrics reports, and chart bundles for classroom or stakeholder sharing.
- Guidance: Inline notes on class imbalance, ordinal targets, and cautions around overfitting small datasets.
