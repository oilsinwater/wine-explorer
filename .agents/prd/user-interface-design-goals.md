# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

A streamlined interface that demonstrates the Strudel kit's capabilities for scientific data exploration while maintaining focus on the core use case of wine dataset exploration. The interface should be clean, intuitive, and showcase how the Strudel kit simplifies building scientific data exploration tools.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- Simple dataset switching between red and white wine collections
- Direct manipulation of feature filters with immediate visual feedback
- Clear visualization of data distributions and relationships
- Responsive design that works across device sizes

## Core Screens and Views

- Main exploration view with dataset selector, filters, and visualization area
- Dataset information panel showing metadata and citation information

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The prototype should follow basic accessibility guidelines to ensure it can be used by a wide range of users, though full accessibility implementation is not required for this prototype.

## Branding

Use clean, modern styling that focuses attention on the data and visualizations rather than decorative elements. Follow Strudel kit's default styling conventions.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The prototype should work on modern web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and mobile devices.
