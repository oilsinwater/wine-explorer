# Wine Explorer Microsite - Prototype Brief

## Executive Summary

This prototype demonstrates the capabilities of the Strudel kit for scientific data exploration by creating a focused microsite for the UCI Wine Quality datasets. The project showcases how to build an integrated interface for exploring both red and white wine datasets with basic filtering and visualization capabilities, all within a one-month development timeline.

## Problem Statement

Current public examples of wine quality data exploration are fragmented, consisting primarily of prediction-only widgets or course notebooks. Users must switch between multiple tools for filtering, visualization, and modeling across red and white wine datasets. This prototype addresses this gap by demonstrating a unified interface for basic dataset exploration using the Strudel kit.

## Proposed Solution

The Wine Explorer microsite leverages the Strudel kit to create a simplified interface for exploring UCI Wine Quality datasets. The prototype focuses on demonstrating core capabilities of the Strudel kit rather than implementing comprehensive features, making it an ideal showcase of what can be built with this toolkit.

## Target Users

For this prototype, we'll focus on:

### Primary User Segment: Data Practitioners

Data scientists and ML engineers seeking quick Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the wine datasets using a streamlined interface that demonstrates the Strudel kit's capabilities.

### Secondary User Segment: Educators and Students

Educators and students looking for simple interactive charts and dataset exploration tools that can serve as examples of scientific data visualization.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria

- Successful rendering of both red and white wine datasets
- Functional dataset switching between the two wine types
- Working basic filters for key features (alcohol content, pH, acidity)
- Display of simple visualizations (histograms, scatterplots)
- Demonstration of prototype within one-month timeframe
- Showcase of Strudel kit capabilities for scientific data exploration

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Dataset Switcher:** Toggle between red and white wine datasets with clear indication of currently selected dataset and instance counts
- **Basic Filtering:** Range sliders for 2-3 key physicochemical features (e.g., alcohol content, pH, volatile acidity)
- **Simple Visualizations:** Histograms and scatterplots for selected features with basic interactivity
- **Dataset Information:** Display of dataset metadata including source, citation, and number of instances
- **Responsive Design:** Basic responsive layout that works on common device sizes

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Advanced filtering for all 11 physicochemical features
- Complex EDA visuals (correlation heatmaps, box plots, etc.)
- "What-if" prediction functionality
- Model explainability features
- Export functionality (CSV, PNG, SVG)
- Linked multi-view dashboards with brushing and highlighting
- Save/share view states
- API endpoints for programmatic data access

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

- Advanced filtering for all 11 features
- Comprehensive EDA visuals including correlation matrices and distribution plots
- Predictive modeling capabilities with "what-if" scenario testing
- Model explanation features

### Long-term Vision

A full-featured scientific data exploration platform that demonstrates the complete capabilities of the Strudel kit for various domain datasets beyond wine quality.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms:** Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Performance Requirements:** Client-side processing suitable for datasets under 10MB

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Strudel kit components
- **Data Handling:** Direct CSV parsing and client-side data processing
- **Visualization:** Basic charting library compatible with Strudel kit

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure:** Simple single-page application structure
- **Data Loading:** Static CSV files hosted with the application

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Timeline:** One-month development timeframe
- **Resources:** Limited to core team with Strudel kit expertise
- **Technical:** Focus on client-side implementation only

### Key Assumptions

- UCI Wine Quality datasets will remain accessible at their current URLs
- Basic visualizations will be sufficient to demonstrate Strudel kit capabilities
- Simple filtering will adequately showcase interactive features

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Scope Creep:** Adding features beyond the essential prototype scope
- **Performance:** Ensuring responsive interactions with full datasets

### Open Questions

- Which specific physicochemical features should be prioritized for filtering?
- What level of visualization customization is needed for the prototype?

## Next Steps

1. Confirm final feature set for prototype implementation
2. Begin development using Strudel kit components
3. Test with target user groups (data practitioners, educators)
4. Document lessons learned for future Strudel kit projects
