# Wine Explorer Prototype Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create a simplified microsite prototype demonstrating the Strudel kit's capabilities for scientific data exploration
- Enable basic exploration of UCI Wine Quality datasets (red and white) with minimal filtering and visualization
- Deliver a functional prototype within a one-month development timeline
- Showcase core Strudel kit components for dataset switching, basic filtering, and simple visualizations

### Background Context

The Wine Explorer prototype addresses the need for a demonstration of the Strudel kit's capabilities in scientific data exploration. Current public examples of wine quality data exploration are fragmented, consisting primarily of prediction-only widgets or course notebooks. Users must switch between multiple tools for basic dataset exploration. This prototype demonstrates how the Strudel kit can unify basic dataset exploration in a single interface, serving as an example of what can be built with this toolkit in a short development timeframe.

## Requirements

### Functional

FR1: Users can switch between red and white wine datasets with clear indication of currently selected dataset
FR2: Users can filter 2-3 key physicochemical features using range sliders
FR3: Users can view histograms and scatterplots for selected features
FR4: Users can see dataset metadata including source, citation, and number of instances
FR5: Interface is responsive and works on common device sizes

### Non Functional

NFR1: All interactions must be client-side with no external dependencies beyond UCI dataset CSVs
NFR2: Application must load and render visualizations within 2 seconds on modern browsers
NFR3: Code must follow Strudel kit component patterns and conventions
NFR4: Prototype must be completed and demonstrable within one-month timeframe

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

A streamlined interface that demonstrates the Strudel kit's capabilities for scientific data exploration while maintaining focus on the core use case of wine dataset exploration. The interface should be clean, intuitive, and showcase how the Strudel kit simplifies building scientific data exploration tools.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- Simple dataset switching between red and white wine collections
- Direct manipulation of feature filters with immediate visual feedback
- Clear visualization of data distributions and relationships
- Responsive design that works across device sizes

### Core Screens and Views

- Main exploration view with dataset selector, filters, and visualization area
- Dataset information panel showing metadata and citation information

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The prototype should follow basic accessibility guidelines to ensure it can be used by a wide range of users, though full accessibility implementation is not required for this prototype.

### Branding

Use clean, modern styling that focuses attention on the data and visualizations rather than decorative elements. Follow Strudel kit's default styling conventions.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The prototype should work on modern web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The prototype will be a single-page application with all code in one repository.

### Service Architecture

Client-side only implementation with no backend services. Data will be loaded directly from UCI CSV files.

### Testing Requirements

Unit testing for core components and basic integration testing for the main user flows.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- Use Strudel kit components for UI elements and data visualization
- Implement with modern JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- Keep dependencies minimal to focus on Strudel kit demonstration
- Use client-side CSV parsing for dataset loading

## Epic List

Epic 1: Foundation & Core Prototype: Establish project setup, dataset loading, and basic UI components
Epic 2: Core Exploration Features: Implement dataset switching, basic filtering, and simple visualizations
Epic 3: Prototype Polish & Documentation: Finalize prototype, add documentation, and prepare for demonstration

## Checklist Results Report

# PM Checklist Results for Wine Explorer Prototype

## Executive Summary

The Wine Explorer Prototype PRD has been reviewed against the PM checklist criteria. Overall, the document is well-structured and appropriate for a one-month prototype development effort. The scope has been properly constrained to focus on demonstrating the Strudel kit's capabilities rather than building a comprehensive data exploration tool.

**Overall PRD Completeness**: 85%
**MVP Scope Appropriateness**: Just Right
**Readiness for Architecture Phase**: Ready
**Most Critical Gaps**: Some detail needed in user experience requirements and story breakdown

**Complexity concerns**:

- The scope is appropriately simple for demonstrating Strudel kit capabilities

**Timeline realism**:

- The one-month timeline is realistic for the defined scope

## Technical Readiness

The technical requirements are clearly defined with appropriate constraints for a prototype:

**Clarity of technical constraints**:

- Well-defined as client-side only implementation

**Identified technical risks**:

- Minimal for this prototype scope

**Areas needing architect investigation**:

- None critical for prototype development

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:

   - Expand UI requirements with more specific component details
   - Break down epics into more detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
   - Add basic operational requirements for prototype deployment

2. **Improvements**:

   - Consider adding simple wireframes or mockups to clarify UI expectations
   - Include more specific performance targets
   - Document rollback procedures for prototype deployment

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Proceed to architectural design phase
   - Begin story breakdown with more detailed acceptance criteria
   - Create basic UI mockups to guide development

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The prototype scope is well-defined and achievable within the one-month timeline.
