3.2 Accessibility Implementation

## Date

2025-09-22

## Overview

This document outlines the test scenarios and approach for validating the accessibility implementation in the Wine Explorer application. The feature aims to make the application usable by people with disabilities by following WCAG AA accessibility guidelines.

## Test Approach

- Automated accessibility testing using tools like axe-core
- Manual accessibility testing with keyboard-only navigation
- Screen reader testing with popular screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Color contrast testing with tools like WAVE or axe
- Testing with assistive technologies
- Cross-browser testing with accessibility tools enabled
- User testing with people who have disabilities (if possible)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Keyboard Navigation

**Objective**: Verify that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and follow logical tab order.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User has no mouse available (physically or by choice)

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate to the application using only the Tab key
2. Verify that focus moves through elements in a logical order
3. Use Shift+Tab to navigate backwards and verify reverse tab order
4. Activate interactive elements using Enter or Space keys
5. Verify that all interactive elements can be activated via keyboard
6. Test keyboard shortcuts where implemented
7. Verify that focus is visible on all interactive elements

**Expected Results**:

- All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard
- Tab order follows logical flow (header → navigation → main content → footer)
- All interactive elements can be activated using keyboard
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- Keyboard shortcuts work as documented

### 2. Screen Reader Support

**Objective**: Verify that screen reader users can effectively navigate and use the application.

**Preconditions**:

- Screen reader is enabled (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
- Application is running

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate through the application using screen reader commands
2. Verify that all content is announced appropriately
3. Check that ARIA labels and descriptions are meaningful
4. Verify that dynamic content changes are announced
5. Test form inputs and validation messages
6. Verify that error messages are announced
7. Check that visualizations have appropriate alternative text

**Expected Results**:

- All content is announced by the screen reader
- ARIA labels and descriptions are meaningful and accurate
- Dynamic content changes trigger appropriate announcements
- Form inputs and validation messages are announced
- Error messages are announced with sufficient context
- Visualizations have descriptive alternative text

### 3. Color Contrast

**Objective**: Verify that color contrast meets WCAG AA requirements throughout the application.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- Color contrast testing tools are available (WAVE, axe, or browser extensions)

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate through all pages and components
2. Check color contrast ratios for text and UI components
3. Verify that normal text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
4. Verify that large text has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1
5. Verify that UI components have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1
6. Test with high contrast mode enabled
7. Test with color blindness simulators

**Expected Results**:

- All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
- All UI components meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
- High contrast mode provides sufficient contrast for all elements
- Color-coding information is available through text or other non-color means
- No contrast issues are identified by automated testing tools

### 4. Focus Management

**Objective**: Verify that focus is properly managed during user interactions and dynamic content changes.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is navigating with keyboard

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate through the application with keyboard
2. Verify that focus indicators are visible and distinct
3. Trigger dynamic content changes (form submissions, data loading)
4. Verify that focus is managed appropriately during and after content changes
5. Test modal dialogs and focus trapping
6. Verify that skip links work correctly
7. Test focus movement during filtering and data updates

**Expected Results**:

- Focus indicators are clearly visible and consistent
- Focus is maintained or appropriately moved during content changes
- Modal dialogs trap focus correctly
- Skip links allow users to bypass repetitive content
- Focus moves logically during filtering and data updates

### 5. Semantic HTML

**Objective**: Verify that the application uses proper semantic HTML for content structure.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- HTML validation tools are available

**Test Steps**:

1. Inspect the HTML structure of key pages
2. Verify that proper heading levels are used (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
3. Check that landmark roles are properly implemented
4. Verify that appropriate HTML elements are used for content
5. Validate HTML semantics with automated tools
6. Check that form elements have proper labels
7. Verify that tables have proper headers and structure

**Expected Results**:

- Proper heading hierarchy is maintained
- Landmark roles (header, nav, main, footer) are correctly implemented
- Appropriate HTML elements are used for content types
- HTML validates without semantic errors
- Form elements have associated labels
- Tables have proper header structure

### 6. Alternative Text for Visualizations

**Objective**: Verify that data visualizations have appropriate alternative text for users who cannot see them.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- Data is loaded

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate to visualization components
2. Check that visualizations have descriptive alternative text
3. Verify that screen readers announce the alternative text
4. Test that alternative text is updated when data changes
5. Verify that summary statistics are provided
6. Check that axes and data points have appropriate labels
7. Test with different datasets and filters

**Expected Results**:

- Visualizations have descriptive alternative text
- Screen readers announce the alternative text appropriately
- Alternative text is updated when data changes
- Summary statistics are provided for context
- Axes and data points have meaningful labels
- Alternative text works with different datasets and filters

### 7. High Contrast Mode

**Objective**: Verify that the high contrast mode provides sufficient contrast for users with low vision.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- High contrast mode toggle is available

**Test Steps**:

1. Activate high contrast mode
2. Navigate through all pages and components
3. Verify that all elements have sufficient contrast
4. Check that text remains readable
5. Verify that focus indicators are visible
6. Test that the mode persists across sessions
7. Check that the mode can be toggled on and off

**Expected Results**:

- All elements have sufficient contrast in high contrast mode
- Text remains readable and clear
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- High contrast mode preference is persisted across sessions
- Mode can be easily toggled on and off

### 8. Error Handling and Notifications

**Objective**: Verify that error messages and notifications are accessible to users with disabilities.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- Error conditions can be simulated

**Test Steps**:

1. Trigger error conditions in the application
2. Verify that error messages are announced by screen readers
3. Check that error messages have appropriate ARIA roles (alert, status)
4. Verify that focus is directed to error messages when appropriate
5. Test that error messages provide sufficient context for resolution
6. Check that form validation errors are announced
7. Verify that success messages are also announced appropriately

**Expected Results**:

- Error messages are announced by screen readers
- Error messages have appropriate ARIA roles
- Focus is directed to error messages when they appear
- Error messages provide clear context for resolution
- Form validation errors are announced with field context
- Success messages are announced appropriately
