## Detailed NFR Assessment

### Accessibility

**Requirement**: The application must follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines to be usable by people with disabilities.

**Assessment**:
The implementation provides a strong foundation for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with several key features implemented:

- Keyboard navigation with logical tab order and skip links
- Screen reader support with ARIA attributes and live regions
- High contrast mode with persistent settings
- Focus management with visible indicators and proper focus trapping
- Semantic HTML with proper landmarks and heading structure
- Alternative text for data visualizations

**Rating**: Good - Core features are well implemented but full WCAG audit still needed

**Evidence**:

- AccessibilityContext.tsx provides centralized accessibility utilities
- Layout.tsx implements skip links for keyboard navigation
- DatasetSelector.tsx, FilterPanel.tsx, VisualizationArea.tsx use proper ARIA attributes
- HistogramPlot.tsx and ScatterPlot.tsx generate alternative text for visualizations

### Usability

**Requirement**: The application should provide an enhanced user experience for people with disabilities.

**Assessment**:
Significant improvements have been made for users who rely on keyboards or screen readers:

- Skip links allow keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation
- Focus indicators are clearly visible and consistent
- Screen reader announcements provide context for dynamic content changes
- High contrast mode improves readability for users with low vision
- Alternative text descriptions make data visualizations accessible

**Rating**: Excellent - Strong implementation of usability enhancements

**Evidence**:

- Skip links in Layout.tsx
- Visible focus indicators throughout components
- Screen reader announcements in AccessibilityContext.tsx
- High contrast mode in AccessibilityContext.tsx
- Alternative text generation in statistics.ts

### Performance

**Requirement**: Accessibility features should have minimal impact on application performance.

**Assessment**:
The accessibility features are implemented efficiently with minimal performance overhead:

- Screen reader announcements use requestAnimationFrame for optimal performance
- ARIA attributes and live regions are updated efficiently
- High contrast mode changes are implemented with CSS variables for performance
- Focus management doesn't introduce noticeable delays

**Rating**: Excellent - Efficient implementation with minimal overhead

**Evidence**:

- AccessibilityContext.tsx uses requestAnimationFrame for announcements
- CSS-based high contrast implementation in AccessibilityContext.tsx
- Efficient focus management in component implementations

### Security

**Requirement**: Accessibility features should not introduce new security vulnerabilities.

**Assessment**:
The accessibility implementation doesn't introduce any new security concerns:

- No client-side storage of sensitive information
- No new attack vectors introduced by accessibility features
- Standard web accessibility practices followed

**Rating**: Excellent - No security implications

**Evidence**:

- localStorage only used for high contrast preference (non-sensitive)
- Standard ARIA attributes and accessibility patterns
- No executable code in accessibility features

### Maintainability

**Requirement**: The accessibility implementation should be clean, modular, and easy to maintain.

**Assessment**:
The implementation follows good software engineering practices with a modular approach:

- AccessibilityContext.tsx provides centralized accessibility utilities
- Reusable components implement accessibility consistently
- Clear separation of concerns between accessibility logic and business logic
- Well-documented code with appropriate comments

**Rating**: Good - Well-structured implementation with room for expansion

**Evidence**:

- AccessibilityContext.tsx centralizes accessibility functionality
- Consistent ARIA attribute implementation across components
- Clear component structure and separation of concerns

### Scalability

**Requirement**: Accessibility features should work effectively as the application grows and handles larger datasets.

**Assessment**:
The implementation scales well with increasing data volumes:

- Alternative text for visualizations is generated dynamically based on data
- Screen reader announcements are efficient regardless of data size
- Focus management works consistently with varying numbers of interactive elements

**Rating**: Good - Implementation scales with data volume

**Evidence**:

- Dynamic alternative text generation in statistics.ts
- Efficient screen reader announcement system
- Consistent focus management regardless of component count

### Reliability

**Requirement**: Accessibility features should behave consistently across user sessions.

**Assessment**:
The implementation provides reliable accessibility features:

- High contrast preference is persisted using localStorage
- Screen reader announcements work consistently
- Focus management behaves predictably
- Skip links are always available

**Rating**: Excellent - Consistent behavior with persistent settings

**Evidence**:

- localStorage persistence for high contrast preference in AccessibilityContext.tsx
- Consistent implementation of accessibility features across sessions
- Reliable focus management and skip links

### Compatibility

**Requirement**: Accessibility features should work across different browsers and with various assistive technologies.

**Assessment**:
The implementation follows standard web accessibility practices that work across browsers:

- Standard ARIA attributes supported by all modern browsers
- Semantic HTML works with all assistive technologies
- CSS-based implementation compatible with different browsers
- Keyboard navigation follows standard patterns

**Rating**: Good - Follows standard accessibility patterns

**Evidence**:

- Standard ARIA attributes used throughout components
- Semantic HTML implementation
- Cross-browser compatible CSS
- Standard keyboard navigation patterns

## NFR Compliance Summary

| --------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Accessibility   | Good      | In Progress       |
| Usability       | Excellent | Implemented       |
| Performance     | Excellent | Implemented       |
| Security        | Excellent | Implemented       |
| Maintainability | Good      | Implemented       |
| Scalability     | Good      | Implemented       |
| Reliability     | Excellent | Implemented       |
| Compatibility   | Good      | Implemented       |

## Recommendations

1. Complete full WCAG 2.1 AA audit to ensure comprehensive compliance
2. Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) for compatibility verification
3. Conduct user testing with people who have disabilities for real-world validation
4. Implement automated accessibility testing in CI pipeline
5. Document accessibility features for end users in user guides

## Conclusion

The accessibility implementation demonstrates strong adherence to NFRs with excellent performance, security, reliability, and usability characteristics. The core accessibility features are well implemented, providing a solid foundation for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. The remaining work focuses on comprehensive testing and documentation to ensure full compliance and optimal user experience for people with disabilities.
