| R08     | Accessibility     | Keyboard navigation issues                    | Low         | Low    | Low        | Implement proper keyboard focus management; test tab navigation          |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### High Priority Risks

None - all previously high priority risks have been mitigated through detailed specifications.

### Medium Priority Risks

#### R01: Strudel Kit Integration

- **Description**: Potential issues with integrating Strudel Kit components
- **Impact**: Delays in implementation; inconsistent UI
- **Mitigation**:
  - Follow official Strudel Kit documentation
  - Use provided examples as reference
  - Consult with team members familiar with Strudel Kit

#### R03: Accessibility Compliance

- **Description**: Risk of not meeting WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
- **Impact**: Application unusable for users with disabilities; potential legal issues
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement detailed accessibility requirements from story
  - Test with automated accessibility tools
  - Conduct manual testing with keyboard navigation

#### R04: Responsive Design Issues

- **Description**: Layout problems on different screen sizes
- **Impact**: Poor user experience on mobile devices
- **Mitigation**:
  - Test on specified devices and breakpoints from story
  - Follow frontend specification breakpoints
  - Use responsive design techniques (flexbox, grid)

#### R06: Test Coverage

- **Description**: Insufficient testing of UI components
- **Impact**: Bugs in production; difficulty maintaining code
- **Mitigation**:
  - Write comprehensive unit tests as specified in story
  - Test event handling and user interactions
  - Test responsive behavior and accessibility features

### Low Priority Risks

#### R02: Component State Management

- **Description**: Issues with managing component state and data flow
- **Impact**: Incorrect UI behavior; difficult to maintain code
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use React Context API as specified in story
  - Implement proper data flow between components

#### R05: Performance Issues

- **Description**: Slow rendering of UI components
- **Impact**: Poor user experience
- **Mitigation**:
  - Optimize component rendering
  - Use React.memo for performance optimization
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders

#### R07: CSS Styling Issues

- **Description**: Styling conflicts or inconsistencies
- **Impact**: Inconsistent UI appearance
- **Mitigation**:
  - Follow established styling guidelines from story
  - Use CSS variables for consistent theming
  - Review styles during code reviews

#### R08: Keyboard Navigation

- **Description**: Issues with keyboard navigation
- **Impact**: Poor accessibility for keyboard users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement proper keyboard focus management as specified
  - Test tab navigation through all components
  - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

## Risk Monitoring Plan

1. Conduct accessibility testing during development
2. Test responsive design on multiple screen sizes
3. Review test coverage regularly
4. Perform code reviews focusing on state management and styling
