# Test Design: 2.2 Filtering Implementation

## Story

2.2 Filtering Implementation

## Date

2025-09-22

## Overview

This document outlines the test scenarios and approach for validating the filtering implementation feature in the Wine Explorer application. The feature allows users to filter wine datasets based on physicochemical features using range sliders.

## Test Approach

- Unit tests for filtering logic in WineDataManager
- Component tests for FilterPanel UI
- Integration tests for filter functionality across components
- Accessibility tests for screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- Performance tests for filtering with large datasets

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Filter Panel UI

**Objective**: Verify that the FilterPanel component renders correctly and handles user interactions.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate to the wine explorer page
2. Observe the FilterPanel component
3. Verify that range sliders for alcohol, pH, and volatile acidity are displayed
4. Check that current filter values are displayed
5. Verify that the "Clear All" button is present

**Expected Results**:

- FilterPanel component is rendered correctly
- Range sliders for all three key features are visible
- Current filter values are displayed accurately
- "Clear All" button is present and enabled

### 2. Filter Functionality

**Objective**: Verify that filtering works correctly and updates the displayed data.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- Wine data is loaded

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate to the wine explorer page
2. Adjust the alcohol content filter
3. Observe the changes in the info panel and visualizations
4. Adjust the pH level filter
5. Observe the changes in the info panel and visualizations
6. Adjust the volatile acidity filter
7. Observe the changes in the info panel and visualizations

**Expected Results**:

- Info panel updates to show the correct number of filtered instances
- Visualizations update to show only the filtered data
- Filter changes are debounced (300ms delay) to optimize performance

### 3. Clear Filters

**Objective**: Verify that the "Clear All" button resets all filters to their default values.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- Filters have been adjusted from their default values

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate to the wine explorer page
2. Adjust one or more filters
3. Click the "Clear All" button
4. Observe the filter values and displayed data

**Expected Results**:

- All filter values return to their default ranges
- Info panel shows the total number of instances in the dataset
- Visualizations display the complete dataset

### 4. Performance with Large Datasets

**Objective**: Verify that filtering performance meets the 2-second requirement with large datasets.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- White wine dataset (4,898 instances) is loaded

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate to the wine explorer page
2. Switch to the white wine dataset
3. Adjust one or more filters
4. Measure the time from filter adjustment to visualization update
5. Repeat with different filter combinations

**Expected Results**:

- Filtering operations complete within 2 seconds
- Loading indicators are displayed during filtering
- User interface remains responsive during filtering

### 5. Edge Cases

**Objective**: Verify that filtering handles edge cases correctly.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- Wine data is loaded

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate to the wine explorer page
2. Set filters to values that match no data points
3. Observe the results
4. Set filters to extreme values (minimum and maximum)
5. Observe the results
6. Set filters to very narrow ranges
7. Observe the results

**Expected Results**:

- When no data matches the filters, the info panel shows "0 instances" and visualizations are empty
- Extreme filter values work correctly without errors
- Narrow filter ranges work correctly and show appropriate data

### 6. Accessibility

**Objective**: Verify that the filtering feature is accessible to users with disabilities.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- Screen reader is enabled (for screen reader tests)

**Test Steps**:

1. Navigate to the wine explorer page
2. Use Tab key to navigate to filter controls
3. Use keyboard to adjust filter values
4. Verify that screen reader announcements are provided when filters change
5. Verify that all interactive elements have proper labels

**Expected Results**:

- Filter controls are keyboard accessible
- Screen reader announcements provide feedback when filters change
- All interactive elements have appropriate ARIA labels

## Test Data

- Red wine dataset (1,599 instances)
- White wine dataset (4,898 instances)
- Sample data with known values for testing edge cases

## Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass
- All component tests pass
- All integration tests pass
- All accessibility tests pass
- Performance requirements are met
- No critical or high severity bugs are found

## Test Tools

- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Manual testing for accessibility verification
- Performance monitoring tools for performance testing

## Test Deliverables

- Unit tests for WineDataManager filtering functions
- Component tests for FilterPanel
- Integration tests for filter functionality
- Accessibility test results
- Performance test results
- Bug reports for any issues found
