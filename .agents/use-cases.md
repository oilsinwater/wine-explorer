# Wine Explorer Prototype Use Cases

## Document Overview

This document details the specific use cases for the Wine Explorer prototype. The prototype focuses on demonstrating the Strudel kit's capabilities for scientific data exploration with a simplified feature set. These use cases are tailored to the one-month development timeline and the core functionality of dataset switching, basic filtering, and simple visualizations.

## Target Users and Personas

Based on the existing personas, we'll focus on two primary user groups for the prototype:

1. **Data Practitioners** (Data Scientists and ML Engineers)
2. **Educators and Students**

## Detailed Use Cases

### UC-1: Switch Between Wine Datasets

**Primary Actor:** Data Practitioner, Educator/Student

**Description:** Users need to compare characteristics between red and white wine datasets.

**Preconditions:**

- User has accessed the Wine Explorer prototype
- Both red and white wine datasets are available

**Main Flow:**

1. User views the default dataset (red wine)
2. User identifies the dataset toggle control
3. User switches to the alternative dataset (white wine)
4. System loads and displays the new dataset
5. System updates metadata display with new dataset information

**Alternative Flows:**

- If dataset loading fails, system displays error message with retry option

**Postconditions:**

- Correct dataset is displayed
- Metadata panel shows information for the selected dataset

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Dataset switch occurs within 1 second
- Visual indication clearly shows which dataset is active
- All visualizations update to reflect the new dataset

### UC-2: Filter Dataset by Physicochemical Features

**Primary Actor:** Data Practitioner, Educator/Student

**Description:** Users want to focus their analysis on specific subsets of the data by filtering based on key physicochemical features.

**Preconditions:**

- User has selected a dataset (red or white wine)
- Filter controls are available for 2-3 key features

**Main Flow:**

1. User identifies filter controls for desired features
2. User adjusts range sliders or inputs values for filtering
3. System applies filter to dataset
4. System updates visualizations to show filtered data
5. System updates metadata counts to reflect filtered data

**Alternative Flows:**

- If no data matches filter criteria, system displays appropriate message
- If invalid filter range is entered, system shows validation message

**Postconditions:**

- Visualizations display only data that matches filter criteria
- Metadata reflects the count of filtered data points

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Filter application occurs within 500ms
- Visual feedback indicates active filter states
- All visualizations update consistently with filtered data

### UC-3: Explore Data Distributions Through Visualizations

**Primary Actor:** Data Practitioner, Educator/Student

**Description:** Users want to understand the distribution of physicochemical features in the dataset through histograms and scatterplots.

**Preconditions:**

- User has selected a dataset
- Dataset is displayed in visualization area

**Main Flow:**

1. User views histogram for a selected feature
2. User identifies patterns or outliers in the distribution
3. User views scatterplot comparing two features
4. User interprets relationships between features

**Alternative Flows:**

- If visualization fails to load, system displays error message
- If dataset is empty (after filtering), system displays appropriate message

**Postconditions:**

- User has viewed relevant visualizations
- User can interpret basic characteristics of the data

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Histograms render within 300ms
- Scatterplots render within 300ms
- Visualizations include clear axis labels and titles
- Tooltips provide additional information on hover

### UC-4: Access Dataset Metadata and Citation Information

**Primary Actor:** Data Practitioner, Educator/Student

**Description:** Users need to understand the source and characteristics of the dataset they're exploring.

**Preconditions:**

- User has selected a dataset
- Metadata panel is available

**Main Flow:**

1. User identifies metadata panel
2. User views dataset source information
3. User views citation information
4. User views instance count for the dataset
5. User views instance count after applying filters

**Alternative Flows:**

- If metadata is unavailable, system displays appropriate message

**Postconditions:**

- User has access to dataset source and citation information
- User understands the size of the dataset

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Metadata panel is clearly visible
- Source and citation information is accurate
- Instance counts update appropriately when filters are applied

### UC-5: View Interface on Different Device Sizes

**Primary Actor:** Data Practitioner, Educator/Student

**Description:** Users access the Wine Explorer on various devices and expect a functional interface.

**Preconditions:**

- User accesses the Wine Explorer on a device with a specific screen size

**Main Flow:**

1. User accesses the Wine Explorer prototype
2. System detects device screen size
3. System adapts layout for optimal viewing
4. User interacts with the interface
5. All interactive elements are accessible

**Alternative Flows:**

- If device is below minimum supported size, system displays message

**Postconditions:**

- Interface is usable on the device
- All core functionality is accessible

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Interface adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- All interactive elements meet minimum touch target sizes
- Core functionality remains consistent across devices

## Prototype-Specific Considerations

### Out of Scope Use Cases

The following use cases are identified in the full feature set but are not part of the prototype scope:

- "What-if" prediction scenarios
- Model quick-start and comparison
- Advanced correlation analysis
- Export functionality
- Linked multi-view dashboards
- Save/share view states

### Simplified User Interactions

For the prototype, user interactions are intentionally simplified:

- Limited to 2-3 key physicochemical features for filtering
- Basic visualizations (histograms and scatterplots only)
- Single-page application with no complex navigation

## Success Metrics for Use Cases

To measure the effectiveness of our prototype use cases, we'll track:

- Time to complete each core use case (should be under 1 minute)
- User success rate (target 95%)
- User satisfaction with core functionality
- Performance metrics (load times, response times)

## Future Expansion

These use cases will be expanded in future iterations to include:

- Advanced filtering for all 11 physicochemical features
- Comprehensive EDA visuals including correlation matrices
- Predictive modeling capabilities
- Export functionality for data and visualizations
