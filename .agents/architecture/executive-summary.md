# Executive Summary

**Overall Architecture Readiness:** High

**Critical Risks Identified:**

- No backend components (which is intentional for this prototype)
- Limited error handling details
- Minimal security considerations (appropriate for prototype)

**Key Strengths:**

- Clear alignment with PRD requirements for a prototype
- Well-defined technology stack focused on Strudel Kit demonstration
- Simple architecture appropriate for one-month timeline
- Good component structure and organization

**Project Type:** Frontend-only prototype
