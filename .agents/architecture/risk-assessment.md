# Risk Assessment

## Top 5 Risks by Severity

1. **Limited Error Handling** - The architecture defines basic error handling but lacks detail on specific error scenarios and recovery mechanisms.
   _Mitigation:_ Add more detailed error handling patterns and recovery strategies.

2. **Minimal Security Considerations** - While appropriate for a prototype, the architecture has minimal security documentation.
   _Mitigation:_ Add basic security guidelines even for prototype scope.

3. **State Management Clarity** - The state management approach is defined but could use more detail.
   _Mitigation:_ Provide more specific examples of state management patterns.

4. **Performance Optimization Details** - General performance targets are set but specific optimization techniques are not detailed.
   _Mitigation:_ Add specific performance optimization strategies.

5. **Testing Strategy Completeness** - Testing approach is defined but could be more comprehensive.
   _Mitigation:_ Expand testing strategy with more specific examples.
