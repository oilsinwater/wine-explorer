# Developer Documentation

This directory complements the root README by highlighting the most important technical references for Wine Explorer. Each document focuses on a different aspect of the client-only architecture, component design, workflow, and deployment story.

## Document Index

- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — high-level system overview, runtime data flow, and technology choices.
- [`components.md`](components.md) — responsibilities, key props, and accessibility behaviour for major UI components.
- [`development-workflow.md`](development-workflow.md) — local setup, quality checks, branching guidance, and release cadence.
- [`api.md`](api.md) — public surface area for `wineDataManager`, `WineDataContext`, and supporting utilities.
- [`deployment.md`](deployment.md) — hosting considerations, environment variables, and GitHub Pages automation.

Each file is self-contained so new contributors can pick the topic most relevant to their task. Update the index whenever new documentation is added.
