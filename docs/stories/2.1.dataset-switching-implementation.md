# Story 2.1: Dataset Switching Implementation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to implement the complete dataset switching functionality,
**so that** users can seamlessly switch between red and white wine datasets with immediate visual feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dataset toggle component allows switching between red and white wine datasets
2. Application updates all visualizations when dataset is changed
3. Info panel updates to show metadata for the selected dataset
4. Loading indicators are displayed during dataset switching
5. Error handling is implemented for dataset loading failures

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement dataset switching in WineDataManager
  - [ ] Update WineDataManager to handle dataset switching events
  - [ ] Implement data loading for the selected dataset
  - [ ] Update internal state with new dataset
  - [ ] Notify UI components of dataset change
- [ ] Enhance DatasetSelector component
  - [ ] Add loading state indication
  - [ ] Implement error state handling
  - [ ] Add keyboard navigation support

- [ ] Update InfoPanel component
  - [ ] Connect to dataset change events
  - [ ] Update metadata display when dataset changes
  - [ ] Show loading state during dataset switching
- [ ] Implement visualization updates
  - [ ] Connect visualization components to dataset changes
  - [ ] Update visualizations with new dataset data
  - [ ] Show loading indicators during updates
- [ ] Add loading indicators
  - [ ] Implement loading spinner or skeleton screens
  - [ ] Show loading state during dataset switching
  - [ ] Hide loading indicators when data is ready
- [ ] Implement error handling
  - [ ] Handle dataset loading failures
  - [ ] Display user-friendly error messages
  - [ ] Provide retry mechanism
  - [ ] Log errors for debugging
- [ ] Create unit tests
  - [ ] Test dataset switching functionality
  - [ ] Test loading state handling
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios
  - [ ] Test accessibility features

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Details

Based on the frontend specification and architecture document:

**Dataset Toggle Interactions:**

```
State Flow:
Initial → Red Wine Dataset → User Clicks White → Update URL → Load White Dataset → Update UI

Visual Feedback:
- Toggle: Strudel primary color for active dataset
- Transition: 200ms ease-in-out
- Focus: 2px offset outline
- Hover: 10% darker background

Announcements:
"Switching to white wine dataset. Loading 4,898 instances."
```

### Component Integration

The dataset switching implementation requires coordination between multiple components:

1. DatasetSelector - Initiates the dataset change
2. WineDataManager - Manages the dataset loading and storage
3. InfoPanel - Displays dataset metadata
4. Visualization components - Display the dataset visualizations

### State Management

Use the application state management pattern defined in the architecture:

```javascript
const appState = {
  currentDataset: 'red', // 'red' | 'white'
  wineData: [], // Array of WineDataPoint objects
  filteredData: [], // Array of filtered WineDataPoint objects
  filters: {}, // Active filter values
  selectedVisualization: 'histogram', // 'histogram' | 'scatterplot'
  selectedFeatures: {
    x: 'alcohol',
    y: 'pH',
  },
};
```

### Accessibility Requirements

- Follow keyboard navigation map from frontend specification
- Implement screen reader announcements for dataset changes
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes for toggle component
- Maintain focus during dataset switching

### Testing Standards

- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit/components/` directory
- Test dataset switching with both datasets
- Test loading state transitions
- Test error scenarios
- Test accessibility features
- Integration tests for component coordination
