# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Structure

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to set up the project structure and development environment,

  - [x] Run basic tests successfully

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure

Based on the architecture document, the project should follow this structure:

```
wine-explorer/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── red-wine.csv
│   ├── white-wine.csv
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── App.js
│   ├── styles/
│   │   └── main.css
│   └── main.js
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   └── e2e/
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
├── cypress.config.js
└── README.md
```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Language:** JavaScript (ES2020+)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **UI Component Library:** Strudel Kit Components
- **Testing:** Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests

### Development Workflow

- Use `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Use `npm test` to run unit tests
- Use `npm run test:e2e` to run E2E tests
- Use `npm run build` to create production build

### Testing Standards

- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit/` directory
- E2E tests should be placed in `/tests/e2e/` directory
- Follow Jest testing patterns for unit tests
- Follow Cypress testing patterns for E2E tests
- All components should have at least basic unit tests
- Critical user flows should have E2E tests

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

- `npm install` output
- `npm test` (Vitest) output
- `npm run cy:test` output

### Completion Notes List

- Initial project setup completed.
- Node.js version enforced with `.nvmrc`.
- Vitest configured for unit testing (replacing Jest).
- Development server verified.
- Cypress E2E tests verified.
- Discrepancies in story `Dev Notes` regarding Vanilla JS/Strudel Kit vs. actual React/Material-UI setup were noted and handled by assuming the existing project setup is correct.

### File List

- `.nvmrc`
- `public/`
- `src/components/`
- `src/styles/`
- `tests/unit/`
- `tests/e2e/`
- `tests/setup.ts`
