# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Structure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to set up the project structure and development environment,
**so that** I can begin implementing the Wine Explorer prototype with the proper foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project repository is initialized with the correct folder structure
2. Basic development tools are configured (Vite, Jest, Cypress)
3. Strudel Kit is integrated into the project
4. Basic HTML page with Strudel Kit components is displayed
5. Development server can be started and accessed locally

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Create project directory structure based on architecture document
  - [ ] Initialize git repository
  - [ ] Create .gitignore file with appropriate exclusions
- [ ] Set up development environment
  - [ ] Install Node.js and npm
  - [ ] Initialize package.json with project metadata
  - [ ] Install Vite as the build tool
  - [ ] Configure Vite for development and production builds
- [ ] Integrate Strudel Kit
  - [ ] Install Strudel Kit dependencies
  - [ ] Configure Strudel Kit CSS
  - [ ] Verify Strudel Kit components can be imported and used
- [ ] Create basic application structure
  - [ ] Create index.html with basic layout
  - [ ] Create main.js to initialize the application
  - [ ] Create initial component structure (App.js)
- [ ] Set up testing frameworks
  - [ ] Install Jest for unit testing
  - [ ] Install Cypress for E2E testing
  - [ ] Configure test scripts in package.json
- [ ] Verify development workflow
  - [ ] Start development server successfully
  - [ ] Access application in browser

  - [ ] Run basic tests successfully

## Dev Notes
### Project Structure
Based on the architecture document, the project should follow this structure:
```
wine-explorer/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── red-wine.csv
│   ├── white-wine.csv
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── App.js
│   ├── styles/
│   │   └── main.css
│   └── main.js
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   └── e2e/
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
├── cypress.config.js
└── README.md
```

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Language:** JavaScript (ES2020+)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **UI Component Library:** Strudel Kit Components
- **Testing:** Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests

### Development Workflow
- Use `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Use `npm test` to run unit tests
- Use `npm run test:e2e` to run E2E tests
- Use `npm run build` to create production build

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit/` directory
- E2E tests should be placed in `/tests/e2e/` directory
- Follow Jest testing patterns for unit tests
- Follow Cypress testing patterns for E2E tests
- All components should have at least basic unit tests
- Critical user flows should have E2E tests
