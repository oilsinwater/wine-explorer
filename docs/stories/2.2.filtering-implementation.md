# Story 2.2: Filtering Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to implement the filtering functionality for physicochemical features,
**so that** users can filter the wine datasets based on specific feature ranges.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Filter panel provides range sliders for 2-3 key physicochemical features
2. Application filters data in real-time as users adjust sliders
3. Visualizations update to show filtered data
4. Info panel updates to show filtered instance count
5. Clear filters functionality is implemented
6. Filtering performance meets the 2-second requirement

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement FilterPanel component
  - [ ] Create FilterPanel.js component
  - [ ] Add range sliders for key features (alcohol, pH, volatile acidity)
  - [ ] Implement slider value display
  - [ ] Style with Strudel Kit CSS
- [ ] Implement filtering logic
  - [ ] Create filtering function in WineDataService
  - [ ] Apply filters to current dataset
  - [ ] Update filteredData in application state
  - [ ] Implement debounce for performance
- [ ] Connect filtering to UI components
  - [ ] Update InfoPanel with filtered instance count
  - [ ] Update visualization components with filtered data
  - [ ] Implement filter change event handling
- [ ] Implement clear filters functionality
  - [ ] Add "Clear All" button to FilterPanel
  - [ ] Reset all sliders to default values
  - [ ] Clear filtered data and show full dataset
- [ ] Optimize filtering performance
  - [ ] Implement debouncing (300ms delay)
  - [ ] Show loading indicators during filtering
  - [ ] Ensure filtering completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Add accessibility features
  - [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for sliders
  - [ ] Add screen reader announcements for filter changes
  - [ ] Ensure proper ARIA attributes
- [ ] Create unit tests
  - [ ] Test filtering logic with various filter combinations
  - [ ] Test performance with large datasets
  - [ ] Test clear filters functionality
  - [ ] Test accessibility features

## Dev Notes
### Implementation Details
Based on the frontend specification and architecture document:

**Filter Interactions:**
```
Filter Change Sequence:
1. User interaction with slider
2. Update local state immediately
3. Show loading indicator on visualizations
4. Debounce 300ms
5. Update URL params
6. Recalculate filtered data
7. Announce result count
8. Fade in new visualization (200ms)

Slider Behavior:
- Range: Min to Max values for feature
- Handles: Draggable endpoints
- Fill: Highlight between handles
- Labels: Min/Max/current values
```

### Key Features to Filter
Based on the PRD and frontend specification, focus on these key features:
1. Alcohol Content (8.0 - 14.0 for white, 9.0 - 14.0 for red)
2. pH Level (2.7 - 3.8 for white, 2.7 - 4.0 for red)
3. Volatile Acidity (0.1 - 1.1 for white, 0.1 - 1.2 for red)

### Performance Optimization
Follow the filtering performance guidelines from the frontend specification:
- Implement 300ms debounce for filter changes
- Show loading indicators during filtering
- Optimize data filtering algorithms for large datasets
- Test with both red (1,599 instances) and white (4,898 instances) datasets

### Component Integration
The filtering implementation requires coordination between multiple components:
1. FilterPanel - Provides the UI controls
2. WineDataManager - Manages the filtered data
3. InfoPanel - Displays filtered instance count
4. Visualization components - Display the filtered data

### State Management
Update the application state management pattern to include filtering:
```javascript
const appState = {
  currentDataset: 'red', // 'red' | 'white'
  wineData: [], // Array of WineDataPoint objects
  filteredData: [], // Array of filtered WineDataPoint objects
  filters: {
    alcohol: { min: 8.0, max: 14.0 },
    pH: { min: 2.7, max: 4.0 },
    volatileAcidity: { min: 0.1, max: 1.2 }
  },
  selectedVisualization: 'histogram', // 'histogram' | 'scatterplot'
  selectedFeatures: {
    x: 'alcohol',
    y: 'pH'
  }
};
```

### Accessibility Requirements
- Follow keyboard navigation map from frontend specification
- Implement screen reader announcements for filter changes
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes for slider components
- Maintain focus during filtering operations

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit/components/` directory
- Test filtering with various filter combinations
- Test performance with large datasets
- Test clear filters functionality
- Test accessibility features
- Integration tests for component coordination
