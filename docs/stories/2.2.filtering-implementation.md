## Dev Notes

### Implementation Details

Based on the frontend specification and architecture document:

**Filter Interactions:**

```
Filter Change Sequence:
1. User interaction with slider
2. Update local state immediately
3. Show loading indicator on visualizations
4. Debounce 300ms
5. Update URL params
6. Recalculate filtered data
7. Announce result count
8. Fade in new visualization (200ms)

Slider Behavior:
- Range: Min to Max values for feature
- Handles: Draggable endpoints
- Fill: Highlight between handles
- Labels: Min/Max/current values
```

### Key Features to Filter

Based on the PRD and frontend specification, focus on these key features:

1. Alcohol Content (8.0 - 14.0 for white, 9.0 - 14.0 for red)
2. pH Level (2.7 - 3.8 for white, 2.7 - 4.0 for red)
3. Volatile Acidity (0.1 - 1.1 for white, 0.1 - 1.2 for red)

### Performance Optimization

Follow the filtering performance guidelines from the frontend specification:

- Implement 300ms debounce for filter changes
- Show loading indicators during filtering
- Optimize data filtering algorithms for large datasets
- Test with both red (1,599 instances) and white (4,898 instances) datasets

### Component Integration

The filtering implementation requires coordination between multiple components:

1. FilterPanel - Provides the UI controls
2. WineDataManager - Manages the filtered data
3. InfoPanel - Displays filtered instance count
4. Visualization components - Display the filtered data

### State Management

Update the application state management pattern to include filtering:

```javascript
const appState = {
  currentDataset: 'red', // 'red' | 'white'
  wineData: [], // Array of WineDataPoint objects
  filteredData: [], // Array of filtered WineDataPoint objects
  filters: {
    alcohol: { min: 8.0, max: 14.0 },
    pH: { min: 2.7, max: 4.0 },
    volatileAcidity: { min: 0.1, max: 1.2 },
  },
  selectedVisualization: 'histogram', // 'histogram' | 'scatterplot'
  selectedFeatures: {
    x: 'alcohol',
    y: 'pH',
  },
};
```

### Accessibility Requirements

- Follow keyboard navigation map from frontend specification
- Implement screen reader announcements for filter changes
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes for slider components
- Maintain focus during filtering operations

### Testing Standards

- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit/components/` directory
- Test filtering with various filter combinations
- Test performance with large datasets
- Test clear filters functionality
- Test accessibility features
- Integration tests for component coordination
