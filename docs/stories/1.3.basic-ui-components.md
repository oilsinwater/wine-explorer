## Dev Notes

### Component Specifications

Based on the frontend specification, the components should follow these specifications:

**DatasetSelector Component:**

- Use Strudel Kit Toggle Component
- Show active dataset with color coding
- Announce dataset changes to screen readers
- Smooth transition between datasets
- Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space to toggle)

**InfoPanel Component:**

- Use Strudel Kit Card Component
- Display dataset metadata (source, DOI, instance count)
- Update when dataset changes
- Responsive layout

### State Management Approach

- Use React Context API for sharing dataset state between components
- Create a WineDataContext to manage current dataset selection
- Components will consume context values for rendering dataset-specific information
- Dataset changes will update the context, triggering re-renders in dependent components

### Styling Guidelines

Follow the visual design guidelines from the frontend specification:

**Color System:**

```css
--strudel-primary: #2e86ab; /* Blue */
--strudel-secondary: #a23b72; /* Purple */
--strudel-tertiary: #f18f01; /* Orange */
--wine-red: #a23b72; /* Red Wine */
--wine-white: #f18f01; /* White Wine */
```

**Typography:**

```css
--font-family:
  -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', sans-serif;
--text-base: 1rem; /* 16px */
--font-normal: 400;
--leading-normal: 1.5;
```

### Responsive Design

Follow the breakpoint system from the frontend specification:

- Mobile: 0px to 767px
- Tablet: 768px to 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px and above

Test on the following devices/breakpoints:

- Mobile: iPhone SE (375px), iPhone 12 Pro Max (428px)
- Tablet: iPad Mini (768px), iPad Air (820px)
- Desktop: 1024px, 1200px, 1440px
- Test both portrait and landscape orientations for mobile devices

### Accessibility Requirements

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Implement proper keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
- Use ARIA attributes for interactive elements (role, aria-label, aria-describedby)
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Provide screen reader announcements for dataset changes
- Support keyboard activation (Enter/Space) for all interactive elements

### Testing Standards

- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit/components/` directory
- Test component rendering with different props
- Test event handling and user interactions
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes and orientations
- Test accessibility features:
  - Keyboard navigation with Tab, Enter, and Space keys
  - Screen reader announcements for state changes
  - Color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
  - ARIA attributes are properly applied
- Test error states and edge cases
