# Story 3.3: Documentation and README

## Status

Completed

## Summary

We refreshed the public README and rebuilt the developer documentation set to describe the Wine Explorer architecture accurately. The new docs cover runtime data flow, component responsibilities, local development workflow, client-side APIs, and deployment guidance so contributors have a single source of truth.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] README.md provides project overview, setup, quality gate, and deployment instructions.
- [x] Architecture, component, and workflow documentation live under `docs/`.
- [x] API documentation describes the contracts for `wineDataManager`, `WineDataContext`, and supporting utilities.
- [x] Contribution guidelines referenced via `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- [x] Deployment playbook explains build output and GitHub Pages publishing.

## Artifacts

- `README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/components.md`
- `docs/development-workflow.md`
- `docs/api.md`
- `docs/deployment.md`

## Follow-up Ideas

- Capture screenshots or animated GIFs of the exploration workflow for the README.
- Automate Cypress smoke tests against the deployed GitHub Pages environment.
- Expand `docs/api.md` if new context providers or data utilities are introduced.
