# Story 1.2: Dataset Loading and Management

## Status

Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to implement dataset loading from CSV files and create a data management system,
**so that** the application can load and process UCI Wine Quality datasets for visualization.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Application can load red and white wine CSV datasets from the public directory within 2 seconds
2. CSV data is parsed into structured JavaScript objects with proper type validation
3. Data management system can handle both datasets and switch between them in less than 100ms
4. Dataset metadata is extracted and made available to the UI through dedicated getter methods
5. Error handling is implemented for file loading failures with user-friendly error messages displayed in the UI
6. All errors are logged to the console with appropriate error levels (error, warn, info)
7. Memory usage does not exceed 50MB per dataset during loading and parsing

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement CSV loading functionality
  - [ ] Create CSV loader module (csv-loader.js)
  - [ ] Implement async function to load CSV files from public directory using fetch API
  - [ ] Handle file loading errors gracefully (network errors, file not found) with try/catch blocks
- [ ] Parse CSV data into structured objects
  - [ ] Create data parsing function using Papa Parse library with worker threads for large files

  - [ ] Log errors for debugging with structured logging format
- [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Ensure datasets load within 2 seconds on modern browsers using performance API for measurement
  - [ ] Optimize memory usage for large datasets with streaming parser for files >10MB
- [ ] Create unit tests
  - [ ] Test CSV loading functionality with mock fetch responses
  - [ ] Test data parsing functions with valid and invalid data including edge cases
  - [ ] Test data management system with dataset switching scenarios
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios (file not found, parsing errors, network errors)
  - [ ] Test performance with large datasets and verify loading times meet targets

## Dev Notes

### Data Models

Based on the architecture document, the data models are:

**WineDataPoint:**

```typescript
interface WineDataPoint {
  fixedAcidity: number;
  volatileAcidity: number;
  citricAcid: number;
  residualSugar: number;
  chlorides: number;
  freeSulfurDioxide: number;
  totalSulfurDioxide: number;
  density: number;
  pH: number;
  sulphates: number;
  alcohol: number;
  quality: number;
}
```

**DatasetInfo:**

```typescript
interface DatasetInfo {
  type: 'red' | 'white';
  source: string;
  doi: string;
  totalInstances: number;
  features: string[];
}
```

### File Locations

- Red wine dataset: `/public/red-wine.csv`
- White wine dataset: `/public/white-wine.csv`

### Expected CSV Format

Example of the expected CSV format (first few columns of red wine dataset):

```
"fixed acidity","volatile acidity","citric acid","residual sugar","chlorides","free sulfur dioxide","total sulfur dioxide","density","pH","sulphates","alcohol","quality"
7.4,0.7,0,1.9,0.076,11,34,0.9978,3.51,0.56,9.4,5
7.8,0.88,0,2.6,0.098,25,67,0.9968,3.2,0.68,9.8,5
```

### Implementation Approach

- Use Papa Parse as the CSV parsing library (already included in Strudel Kit dependencies)
- Load both datasets on application initialization
- Store datasets in memory for fast access
- Implement lazy loading if datasets are too large (>10MB)
- Optimize parsing for performance with streaming if needed

### Performance Targets

- Dataset loading and parsing should complete within 2 seconds on modern browsers
- Memory usage should not exceed 50MB for each dataset
- Dataset switching should be instantaneous (<100ms)

### Testing Standards

- Unit tests should be placed in `/tests/unit/data/` directory
- Test data parsing with various CSV formats (valid, malformed, empty files)
- Test error scenarios with invalid CSV files and network errors
- Mock file loading for unit tests
- Test dataset switching functionality
- Performance tests to verify loading times meet targets
