## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Error Handling Risk

**Description**: Critical operations like dataset loading could fail without proper error handling, leading to a broken user experience.

**Probability**: Low - With comprehensive error handling implementation, this risk is minimized.

**Impact**: High - Without proper error handling, users would encounter broken functionality with no clear indication of what went wrong.

**Mitigation**:

- Implemented error handling for all critical operations (dataset loading, CSV parsing, filtering, visualization rendering)
- Added user-friendly error messages that provide actionable guidance
- Included retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Added graceful degradation when non-critical features fail

### Performance Risk

**Description**: Loading states might cause the UI to feel unresponsive if not implemented properly.

**Probability**: Medium - Loading operations are frequent in data-heavy applications.

**Impact**: Medium - Poor loading state implementation could make the application feel slow or unresponsive.

**Mitigation**:

- Implemented proper timing for loading indicators (100ms delay, 300ms minimum display time)
- Added skeleton screens for complex components
- Used smooth fade transitions for loading states
- Preserved visual overlays during operations

### Accessibility Risk

**Description**: Error messages and loading states may not be accessible to users with disabilities, particularly those using screen readers.

**Probability**: Low - With proper implementation of accessibility features, this risk can be minimized.

**Impact**: Medium - Without proper accessibility, users with disabilities would have difficulty using the application when errors occur.

**Mitigation**:

- Added screen reader announcements for errors and loading states via polite live regions
- Ensured error messages and retry controls are keyboard accessible
- Implemented proper ARIA attributes for all error and loading states
- Maintained focus during error and loading states

### User Experience Risk

**Description**: Poor error messages might frustrate users and lead to abandonment of the application.

**Probability**: Low - With user-friendly error messages, this risk is reduced.

**Impact**: Medium - Unclear or unhelpful error messages can frustrate users and reduce confidence in the application.

**Mitigation**:

- Implemented clear, actionable error messages
- Added retry options for failed operations
- Ensured graceful degradation when features are not available
- Maintained core functionality even when non-critical features fail

### Logging Risk

**Description**: Errors may not be properly logged, making it difficult to debug production issues.

**Probability**: Low - With centralized error logging implementation, this risk is minimized.

**Impact**: Low - Could make debugging more difficult, but not critical to user experience.

**Mitigation**:

- Implemented centralized error logging with context information
- Added production reporting hooks for future telemetry
- Included error codes and retryable hints in logged payloads

## Risk Monitoring

- Monitor error logs in production environments
- Collect user feedback on error messages and loading experiences
- Review application metrics related to loading times and error frequencies
- Regularly test error handling with various failure scenarios

## Conclusion

The overall risk level for the error handling and loading states implementation is low, with the primary concerns being proper error handling and performance. The implemented mitigations should effectively address these risks, and the feature should provide a robust user experience even when errors occur.
