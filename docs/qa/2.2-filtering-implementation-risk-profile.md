## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Performance Risk

**Description**: The filtering operation might be slow when dealing with large datasets (up to 4,898 instances for white wine).

**Probability**: Medium - With 4,898 instances in the white wine dataset, there's a reasonable chance of performance issues.

**Impact**: High - Slow filtering would degrade the user experience significantly, especially with real-time filtering as users adjust sliders.

**Mitigation**:

- Implemented 300ms debouncing to reduce the frequency of filtering operations
- Optimized the filtering algorithm to efficiently process large datasets
- Added loading indicators to provide feedback during filtering operations

### Accessibility Risk

**Description**: Users with disabilities, particularly those using screen readers, may not receive proper feedback when filters are adjusted.

**Probability**: Low - With proper implementation of accessibility features, this risk can be minimized.

**Impact**: Medium - Without proper feedback, users with disabilities would have difficulty using the filtering feature effectively.

**Mitigation**:

- Added screen reader announcements that provide feedback when filters are updated
- Implemented proper ARIA attributes for all interactive elements
- Ensured keyboard navigation support for all filter controls

### Data Integrity Risk

**Description**: The filtering algorithm might produce incorrect results due to logical errors or edge cases.

**Probability**: Low - With comprehensive testing, the likelihood of errors is reduced.

**Impact**: High - Incorrect filtering results would defeat the purpose of the feature and could lead to incorrect data analysis.

**Mitigation**:

- Created comprehensive unit tests for the filtering logic
- Tested with various filter combinations to ensure correctness
- Verified edge cases such as empty results and extreme filter values

### User Experience Risk

**Description**: Users may find the filter interface confusing or difficult to use effectively.

**Probability**: Low - With clear labeling and immediate feedback, this risk is minimized.

**Impact**: Medium - A confusing interface would reduce the effectiveness of the feature.

**Mitigation**:

- Provided clear labeling of filter ranges and current values
- Implemented immediate visual feedback when filters are adjusted
- Added a "Clear All" button for easy reset of all filters

### Compatibility Risk

**Description**: Range sliders may not function properly in all browsers or may not be supported in older browsers.

**Probability**: Low - Using Material-UI components that have broad browser support.

**Impact**: Low - Users with incompatible browsers can still access the data without filtering.

**Mitigation**:

- Using Material-UI components that have broad browser support
- Following a progressive enhancement approach where basic functionality is available to all users

## Risk Monitoring

- Monitor application performance metrics related to filtering operations
- Collect user feedback on the filtering feature
- Review analytics data to identify any usability issues
- Regularly test the feature with assistive technologies

## Conclusion

The overall risk level for the filtering implementation is moderate, with the primary concern being performance with large datasets. The implemented mitigations should effectively address these risks, and the feature should provide a good user experience for the majority of users.
