## Story

3.1 Error Handling and Loading States

## Date

2025-09-23

## Overview

This document outlines the test scenarios and approach for validating the error handling and loading states implementation in the Wine Explorer application. The feature provides comprehensive error handling and loading states to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Test Approach

- Unit tests for error handling utilities
- Component tests for error and loading states in UI components
- Integration tests for end-to-end error scenarios
- Accessibility tests for screen reader support during errors/loading
- Performance tests for loading state timing

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Dataset Loading Error Handling

**Objective**: Verify that dataset loading errors are properly handled and displayed.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page

**Test Steps**:

1. Simulate a network error during dataset loading
2. Observe the error handling behavior
3. Verify that a user-friendly error message is displayed
4. Verify that a retry option is available
5. Click the retry button
6. Verify that the dataset loads successfully

**Expected Results**:

- Error message is displayed to the user
- Retry button is available
- After clicking retry, the dataset loads successfully

### 2. CSV Parsing Error Handling

**Objective**: Verify that CSV parsing errors are properly handled.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- Malformed CSV file is available

**Test Steps**:

1. Attempt to load a malformed CSV file
2. Observe the error handling behavior
3. Verify that a user-friendly error message is displayed
4. Verify that the application doesn't crash

**Expected Results**:

- Appropriate error message is displayed
- Application remains functional

### 3. Loading State Timing

**Objective**: Verify that loading states follow the specified timing guidelines.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page

**Test Steps**:

1. Trigger a dataset loading operation
2. Measure the time from request to loading indicator display
3. Measure the minimum display time for the loading indicator
4. Measure the fade out transition time

**Expected Results**:

- Loading indicator appears after 100ms delay
- Loading indicator has minimum display time of 300ms
- Fade out transition takes 200ms

### 4. Filter Operation Loading States

**Objective**: Verify that loading states are displayed during filtering operations.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- Dataset is loaded

**Test Steps**:

1. Adjust filter values
2. Observe loading indicators during filtering
3. Verify that visualizations update after filtering completes

**Expected Results**:

- Loading indicators are displayed during filtering
- Visualizations update with filtered data after completion

### 5. Visualization Loading States

**Objective**: Verify that loading states are displayed during visualization rendering.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- Dataset is loaded

**Test Steps**:

1. Switch between visualization types (histogram, scatterplot)
2. Observe loading indicators during rendering
3. Verify that visualizations display after loading

**Expected Results**:

- Loading indicators are displayed during visualization rendering
- Visualizations display after loading completes

### 6. Retry Mechanism

**Objective**: Verify that retry mechanisms work correctly for failed operations.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page

**Test Steps**:

1. Simulate a failure in a critical operation
2. Verify that a retry button is displayed
3. Click the retry button
4. Verify that the operation completes successfully
5. Test automatic retry with exponential backoff

**Expected Results**:

- Retry button is displayed when operations fail
- Retrying the operation results in success
- Automatic retry mechanism works as expected

### 7. Graceful Degradation

**Objective**: Verify that the application degrades gracefully when features are unavailable.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page

**Test Steps**:

1. Simulate a failure in a non-critical feature
2. Verify that core functionality remains available
3. Verify that appropriate fallback content is shown

**Expected Results**:

- Core functionality remains available
- Appropriate fallback content is displayed

### 8. Accessibility

**Objective**: Verify that error and loading states are accessible to users with disabilities.

**Preconditions**:

- Application is running
- User is on the wine explorer page
- Screen reader is enabled (for screen reader tests)

**Test Steps**:

1. Trigger an error condition
2. Verify that screen reader announces the error
3. Trigger a loading state
4. Verify that screen reader announces the loading state
5. Verify that error controls are keyboard accessible

**Expected Results**:

- Screen reader announces errors and loading states
- Error controls are keyboard accessible
- Proper ARIA attributes are used

## Test Data

- Valid CSV files for normal operation
- Malformed CSV files for error testing
- Network error simulation utilities
- Mock data for testing different scenarios

## Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass

- All accessibility tests pass
- Performance requirements are met
- No critical or high severity bugs are found

## Test Tools

- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Manual testing for accessibility verification
- Performance monitoring tools for timing verification

## Test Deliverables

- Unit tests for error handling utilities
- Component tests for UI error and loading states
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
