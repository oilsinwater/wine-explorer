top_issues:
  - id: SM-3_6-TEMPLATE
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Story is free-form and does not use the standard story template (missing Status, Acceptance Criteria section format, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Change Log, etc.).'
    suggested_action: 'Rewrite story using the official template so downstream agents can track progress and update Dev/QA sections.'
    suggested_owner: sm
  - id: SM-3_6-NO_TASKS
    severity: medium
    finding: 'No actionable Tasks/Subtasks are defined; developers lack an execution checklist tied to ACs.'
    suggested_action: 'Add Tasks/Subtasks referencing the key files (`index.tsx`, `wine-explorer.tsx`, router config), testing, and documentation updates.'

  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'No implementation yet, but story does not specify security considerations or regression plan for context providers.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Story acknowledges bundle/perf monitoring but lacks acceptance criteria/tests to enforce it.'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Keyboard navigation and skip-link requirements stated without validation strategy.'
  maintainability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: 'Without template structure, story is difficult to maintain; Dev/QA agents cannot document updates.'
