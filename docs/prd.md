# Wine Explorer Prototype Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a simplified microsite prototype demonstrating the Strudel kit's capabilities for scientific data exploration
- Enable basic exploration of UCI Wine Quality datasets (red and white) with minimal filtering and visualization
- Deliver a functional prototype within a one-month development timeline
- Showcase core Strudel kit components for dataset switching, basic filtering, and simple visualizations

### Background Context
The Wine Explorer prototype addresses the need for a demonstration of the Strudel kit's capabilities in scientific data exploration. Current public examples of wine quality data exploration are fragmented, consisting primarily of prediction-only widgets or course notebooks. Users must switch between multiple tools for basic dataset exploration. This prototype demonstrates how the Strudel kit can unify basic dataset exploration in a single interface, serving as an example of what can be built with this toolkit in a short development timeframe.

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-09-04 | 1.0 | Initial PRD creation | John (Product Manager) |
| 2025-09-08 | 1.1 | Revised for prototype scope | John (Product Manager) |

## Requirements

### Functional
FR1: Users can switch between red and white wine datasets with clear indication of currently selected dataset
FR2: Users can filter 2-3 key physicochemical features using range sliders
FR3: Users can view histograms and scatterplots for selected features
FR4: Users can see dataset metadata including source, citation, and number of instances
FR5: Interface is responsive and works on common device sizes

### Non Functional
NFR1: All interactions must be client-side with no external dependencies beyond UCI dataset CSVs
NFR2: Application must load and render visualizations within 2 seconds on modern browsers
NFR3: Code must follow Strudel kit component patterns and conventions
NFR4: Prototype must be completed and demonstrable within one-month timeframe

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A streamlined interface that demonstrates the Strudel kit's capabilities for scientific data exploration while maintaining focus on the core use case of wine dataset exploration. The interface should be clean, intuitive, and showcase how the Strudel kit simplifies building scientific data exploration tools.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Simple dataset switching between red and white wine collections
- Direct manipulation of feature filters with immediate visual feedback
- Clear visualization of data distributions and relationships
- Responsive design that works across device sizes

### Core Screens and Views
- Main exploration view with dataset selector, filters, and visualization area
- Dataset information panel showing metadata and citation information

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The prototype should follow basic accessibility guidelines to ensure it can be used by a wide range of users, though full accessibility implementation is not required for this prototype.

### Branding
Use clean, modern styling that focuses attention on the data and visualizations rather than decorative elements. Follow Strudel kit's default styling conventions.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The prototype should work on modern web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
The prototype will be a single-page application with all code in one repository.

### Service Architecture
Client-side only implementation with no backend services. Data will be loaded directly from UCI CSV files.

### Testing Requirements
Unit testing for core components and basic integration testing for the main user flows.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use Strudel kit components for UI elements and data visualization
- Implement with modern JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- Keep dependencies minimal to focus on Strudel kit demonstration
- Use client-side CSV parsing for dataset loading

## Epic List
Epic 1: Foundation & Core Prototype: Establish project setup, dataset loading, and basic UI components
Epic 2: Core Exploration Features: Implement dataset switching, basic filtering, and simple visualizations
Epic 3: Prototype Polish & Documentation: Finalize prototype, add documentation, and prepare for demonstration
