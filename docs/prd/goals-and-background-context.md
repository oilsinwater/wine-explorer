# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a simplified microsite prototype demonstrating the Strudel kit's capabilities for scientific data exploration
- Enable basic exploration of UCI Wine Quality datasets (red and white) with minimal filtering and visualization
- Deliver a functional prototype within a one-month development timeline
- Showcase core Strudel kit components for dataset switching, basic filtering, and simple visualizations

## Background Context
The Wine Explorer prototype addresses the need for a demonstration of the Strudel kit's capabilities in scientific data exploration. Current public examples of wine quality data exploration are fragmented, consisting primarily of prediction-only widgets or course notebooks. Users must switch between multiple tools for basic dataset exploration. This prototype demonstrates how the Strudel kit can unify basic dataset exploration in a single interface, serving as an example of what can be built with this toolkit in a short development timeframe.
