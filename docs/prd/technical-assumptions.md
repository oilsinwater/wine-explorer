# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
The prototype will be a single-page application with all code in one repository.

## Service Architecture
Client-side only implementation with no backend services. Data will be loaded directly from UCI CSV files.

## Testing Requirements
Unit testing for core components and basic integration testing for the main user flows.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use Strudel kit components for UI elements and data visualization
- Implement with modern JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- Keep dependencies minimal to focus on Strudel kit demonstration
- Use client-side CSV parsing for dataset loading
